💪 Description
This project analyzes and improves a poor Formula 1 data visualization and creating better visualizations using storytelling and design principles. 
The goal is to go beyond basic charts by creating engaging and meaningful visuals that convey the evolution and dominance of top F1 drivers.

The project was developed as part of the **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization** course, and uses the [Kaggle Formula 1 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).

- Highlights **championship years** with custom markers  
- Adds **trend lines** to show performance arcs  
- Compares **pole positions vs. race wins** in a clean scatter plot  
- Reflects on **design choices** and storytelling value  
- Applies principles from Tufte, Munzner, Cairo, and Kosara

💪 Dependencies
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- (optional) h5py, plotly for extensions

🏎️ How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download the files  
2. Open the notebook or run the script in your Python environment  
3. Ensure all data CSVs are in the same folder  
4. Run the code to generate visualizations and compare versions
